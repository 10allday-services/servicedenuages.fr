:summary: A little tip to enable automatic updates of Slack with Debian and Linux


Installing Slack on Linux
=========================

The proper way to install Slack is to download the installer for your
Operating System on the `Slack website <https://slack.com/downloads>`_.

However I realized my Slack client was not really up-to-date.

When installing Slack, a daily cronjob is installed automatically
which is supposed to configure the automatic updates.

However for some reason on my computer the cronjob never ran.

It is only when I started to encounter problems with my Slack client
that I realized I had an outdated version.

How to verify if Slack is correctly configured?
===============================================

The configuration should create the following file: ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/slack.list``

If this file is missing, you can use the following steps to install it manually.


Configuring APT for Slack updates
=================================

1. First add the `repository key <https://packagecloud.io/app/slacktechnologies/slack/gpg#gpg-apt>`_

.. code-block::

    wget -O - https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack/gpgkey  | sudo apt-key add -


2. Enter your password and you should see the following result.

.. code-block:: bash

    OK

3. Create the file ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/slack.list`` with the following content

.. code-block:: bash

    deb https://packagecloud.io/slacktechnologies/slack/debian/ jessie main

4. Run ``sudo apt update``
5. Run ``sudo apt install slack-desktop``
6. That's it, Slack is now installed and will update itself automatically with APT.

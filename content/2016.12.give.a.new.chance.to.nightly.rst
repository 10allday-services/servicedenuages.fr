Benefit from having a faster Firefox
------------------------------------

Firefox is getting smaller and faster, new features are now tested
through add-ons using `Test Pilot <https://testpilot.firefox.com/>`_
instead of getting added to Firefox.

This means less bugs and only great features by default.



This year 2017, Firefox is going to ship the
`Quantum <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum>`_ project which is a
next-generation web engine which benefit from some parts critical
parts of Gecko being rewritten in Rust which makes them 10 to 100
times faster than before by using parallelization and GPU offloading.

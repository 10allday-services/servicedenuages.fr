It's spring already, and a good time to tidy-up a bit our minds!

We've been stacking interesting experiences without really sharing them in
writings, so now's the time.

There were a francophone conference about Hawk the past year, and some articles
in English in the Mozilla blog, but sometimes the English language doesn't let
us express ourselves in a compelling way.

That's why, in this beginning of spring 2015, we propose a set of articles
written in French and translated in English whenever we can, about what we do in
our little *Service des nuages* team at Mozilla.

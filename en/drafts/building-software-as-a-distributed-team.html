            <p>Today, I realized that I've been working for Mozilla for three years
already.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot, and with the storage team we have been part of a
number of different projects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Firefox Hello: Building a WebRTC signaling service.</li>
<li>MSISDN auth: Building a password less BrowserID authentication service using a phone number.</li>
<li>Syncto: Browsing Firefox Sync using the Kinto protocol.</li>
<li>Kinto: Building synchronization services with backup and sharing capability in mind.</li>
<li>RemoteServiceWorker: Building a Firefox Service Worker in the cloud</li>
<li>WebPush channels: Building a PubSub on top of WebPush</li>
</ul>
<p>While most of these projects have been built, deployed in production
and eventually decommissined, some of them are still actively use by
Firefox users everyday.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-keep-motivated-building-things-that-are-thrown-away">
<h2>How do you keep motivated building things that are thrown away?</h2>
<p>Let's be honest, everything we build: cars, houses, and even softwares
are meant to be eventually thrown away. That's why recycling is so
important.</p>
<p>The question is why do we keep building them nevertheless.</p>
<p>My daily job is to help Mozilla make the web a safe place for users
and prevent big companies to turn them into advertisement products
without their consent.</p>
<p>One way of doing so is to build software that empower people to use
internet while being in charge of their own data.</p>
<p>When users give their data to big companies, they are given them
leverage, in the meantime these companies are offering a service that
solve people problems, and they get addicted to it and come back for
more.</p>
<p>We alone cannot compete with companies that are spending millions of
dollars building great products to capture users.</p>
<p>However, we can build software that, in one hand, is useful for the
Mozilla mission and makes us reactive to fix Mozilla issues while
building Firefox, and in the other hand enpower developers to build
great software where users choose where they want to store their data.</p>
<p>What matters rather than building software is the vision that this
software carries.</p>
<p>Writting lines of code is cheap and fast. You can build a prototype in
two weeks and iterate until you are happy with the result.</p>
<p>Then it might be use by some people and it might get some traction for
few months or few years and it will be eventually forgotten in a git
repository somewhere forever.</p>
<p>Writting software to solve problems is not enough, to keep motivated on the long term.</p>
<p>What you need is a vision and make sure you work toward that vision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-turn-a-vision-into-okr">
<h2>How do you turn a vision into OKR?</h2>
<p>OKR means <strong>Objectives and Key results</strong>, it is a way to define
tangible objectives and key results. You can then look at the results
to tell if you were able to achieve your objectives.</p>
<p>It is also a way to cut your vision in steps and to move your vision
forward.</p>
<p>OKR should be defined for quite short period of time to stay agile and
be able to adapt to new environment constraints.</p>
<p>At Mozilla we define quaterly OKR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-you-set-course-on-a-vision">
<h2>How do you set course on a vision?</h2>
<p>To be able to define OKR from your vision, you need to be able to find
the fastest way to get closer to your vision, however what I've learn
from sailing is that the fastest way is rarely the shortest.</p>
<p>At Mozilla, we have a vision that is written down in the
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla Manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>Mitchell Baker does a great job making sure everyone at Mozilla stays
aligned with that vision.</p>
<p>However agreeing on the fastest way and turning the Mozilla vision
into OKR is really challenging and even more when you have a thousand
people opinion about it.</p>
<p>That's the board job to set course every six months on what we should
be focusing on for the next six months.</p>
<p>This often means changing our course and killing projects or at least
putting them on the side if team are turning over to new priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-chance-is-opensource">
<h2>Our chance is opensource</h2>
<p>The chance we have at Mozilla, is that everything we do is published
as Free, Libre, Opensource Software, which means that, even if, as
Mozilla employee, we focus on something else, the work we've done is
still available for the community to care about it.</p>
<p>Thunderbird is a good example of this, Mozilla stopped spending
resources on it in September 2007 but ten years later Mozilla
Thunderbird is still actively used by a large number of users everyday.</p>
<p>When building software we solve complex issues and all the solutions
we have put together while doing so are really useful for other people
that might need to solve similar problems.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mozilla Persona lead the ground for Firefox Account and Portier.</li>
<li>The Firefox Hello loop server is a good example of how to build a
WebRTC signaling server.</li>
<li>The RemoteServiceWorker projects shows how to use Python 3 asyncio
to handle a large pool of websockets using redis to route messages
between them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prototyping-as-a-way-to-learn">
<h2>Prototyping as a way to learn</h2>
<p>More than writting lines of code, we are researching solutions to
complex problems at scale and turning this solution into, production
ready, experiments.</p>
<p>All this efforts are not lost because we learn a great deal from all
of them.</p>
<p>When we spend a month to one year building something, we are learning.</p>
<p>But everything you learn is useful only if you share it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-as-a-way-to-build-software">
<h2>Sharing as a way to build software</h2>
<p>In one sentence, what matters the most is to build software to put
your vision in motion and to share what you've learned along the way.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are people that you need to inform about what you are
doing and learning about: your colleagues.</p>
<p>You need to explain what you are trying to solve, you need to find out
how to solve the issue and agree on the solution you are putting
together, also having feedback will help you to choose the best
solution even before having written a single line of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-process-of-building-software-in-a-remote-team">
<h2>The process of building software in a remote team</h2>
<p>Working in a remote team is really close from working with a
community.</p>
<p>You need to explicit everything you do, you need to find consensuses,
you need to take feedback, you need to propose solutions and try
things.</p>
<p>As a team, as a community, you are stronger because instead of being
alone you can rely on others to help you make the best choices and
write the best software.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-minimal-viable-prototype-mvp">
<h3>The Minimal Viable Prototype (MVP)</h3>
<p>The first thing to do, is to gather together and brainstorm around the
project to define what is the <strong>Minimal Viable Prototype</strong>.</p>
<p>At this stage it is really important to start talking about
prototypes, the project version <tt class="docutils literal">0.1.0</tt> starts with a <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt> which
means that we are still figuring out what we are doing and possibly
breaking the API, features, expectations.</p>
<p>Everything that is not in the feature set of the MVP is put in a
Roadmap document for later; to document the fact that we thought about
it and that we will possibly care about it later.</p>
<p>We write a small article to resume the discussion and to explain what
is the MVP feature set.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="answering-complex-questions">
<h3>Answering complex questions</h3>
<p>Some features of the MVP might not be trivial.</p>
<p>I have a bunch of examples of hard problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How do you handle permissions in Kinto?</li>
<li>How do we support multiple database backend?</li>
<li>How do we handle <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-editable</span></tt> divs with React or Elm?</li>
<li>How do you implement an OAuth flow from a web-extension?</li>
<li>How do you handle pluggable notifications in Kinto?</li>
<li>How do we configure email notifications in Kinto?</li>
<li>How do we enable people to attach attachment to records in Kinto?</li>
<li>How do we get Firefox Account keys derivated from the password from
an Oauth flow while we never get in touch with the password?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each problem will have to be addressed by someone and presented to the
team members so that they can comment on it. Sometimes the way to go
is obvious, sometimes there is only one good solution, but sometimes
the good solution is not obvious.</p>
<p>When a complex problem arise, what we want is to learn from it and to
share what we've learn. A good way of doing so it to write a Blue
print article exposing pros and cons for the problem and explaining
which solution was chosen, why and how we've implemented it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Make the process of building software a way to learn new things and
share what you've learn. Then you don't have to worry about your
project to be decommissioned because you've already got the take aways
of building it.</p>
<p>Make the process of build software a way to share what you've learned.</p>
<p>Document why you did things that way instead of differently.</p>
<p>Document consensus and decision making.</p>
<p>Document your roadmap and product iterations changelog.</p>
<p>If you start coding without having a Blue Print, it probably means you
are wasting your time because you are building something without
asking for feedback and you are not documenting what you are learning
so that your coworkers benefit from it. You might end-up rewritting
everything after taking feedback.</p>
